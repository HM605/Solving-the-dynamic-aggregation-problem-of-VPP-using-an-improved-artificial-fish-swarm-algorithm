Before start:

The Gurobi, Yamilp, and the DACE toolbox is necessary before start.
The computation time of this program is related to the parallel computing capabilities of the computer. 
To minimize the running time, it is recommended to use a computer with a higher number of cores.


Description:

To execute this program, simply run AF_main.
The Pload.mat file stores the forecast data for photovoltaic generation and load.
Since the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm is a heuristic approach and the optimization model is relatively complex, the search results may vary, albeit not significantly, and all can be considered as executable outcomes. 
It is advisable to run the program multiple times to obtain a more optimal value.
//The code will continue to be updated to improve the universality.
